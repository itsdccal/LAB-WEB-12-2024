                    However, its roots trace back to the city of Makassar in 1947 when 
                    The Faculty Of Economics at the University of Indonesia (UI) Jakarta,
                    was established by the decision of Lieutenant General Governor of 
                    The Dutch East Indies, Number 127 dated July 23, 1947. Due to prolonged
                    uncertainty amd chaos in Makassar and its surroundings, The Faculty, led by 
                    Drs L.A.Enthoven (Director), was suspended, It was later reopened as a branch
                    of Economics UI on October 7, 1953, Under the leadership of Prof. Drs. G.H.M Riekerk.
